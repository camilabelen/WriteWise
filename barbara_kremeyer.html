            <p>Dr. Barbara Kremeyer completed her undergraduate and Master’s studies at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität in Germany, graduating with an MSc in Biology after completing her thesis in the field of ancient DNA. Dr. Kremeyer then gained work experience in the genetics of familial breast cancer at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. She earned a PhD in human genetics from the University College London, conducting her thesis work on the genetics of psychiatric disorders. Dr. Kremeyer has several years of postdoctoral experience in fields such as psychiatric genetics and cancer genomics. In addition, Dr. Kremeyer has published her research in various top-tier scientific journals.</p>
            <p>As a PhD student, postdoc, and teaching fellow at the University College London, Dr. Kremeyer taught genetics to undergraduate and graduate students in both lectures and small group discussions. She has also supervised numerous undergraduate laboratory and literature projects. From 2013 to 2016, she taught biology at one of the UK’s top independent schools.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kremeyer’s academic work has revolved around scientific communication – aiding colleagues, publishing papers, presenting posters, giving presentations, and teaching students through lectures, workshops, and laboratory supervision. Dr. Kremeyer has extensive experience editing and polishing scientific texts, including undergraduate and graduate theses, scientific presentations, grant proposals, and science essays.</p>
            <p>Having lived in South America in her teens, Dr. Kremeyer is also fluent in Spanish. Her professional proficiency in Spanish was cemented through long-standing collaborations with South American research groups during her PhD and postdoctoral work. Also, during these periods, Dr. Kremeyer delivered talks, contributed to research proposals and journal articles, and supervised students in Spanish.</p>
            <p>Currently, Dr. Kremeyer is a key associated researcher for the Linguistics Research Line, where she is applying her vast scientific and communicational expertise to detect linguistic patterns and norms in academic texts.</p>
