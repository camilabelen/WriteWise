Soon after receiving his undergraduate degree and professional certification, David was awarded the <strong>Fulbright Scholarship</strong> to obtain his <strong>PhD in Biophysics at the University of Chicago</strong> (U.S.A.). His doctoral work centered on developing synthetic antibodies as tools to inhibit cell invasion in cancer metastasis.</p>
          <p>Regarding scientific writing, Dr. Weinstein received formal training through the graduate-level course titled <strong>“Academic and Professional Writing”</strong>, at the University of Chicago. Course instruction was given by the team behind The Craft of Research, a highly authoritative and influential book in the field of investigation. David also received informal, yet thorough, training in academic writing from his doctoral advisor, who currently serves on the <strong>Editorial Board of the Journal of Molecular Biology</strong>  Dr. Weinstein has further complimented his knowledge of academic and scientific writing by participating in several grant-writing workshops and work on his own research dissertations and papers.</p>
          <p>Dr. Weinstein is currently a <strong>Scientific Editor at WriteWise</strong>, a role in which he is responsible for critically guiding the development of the WriteWise software by providing <strong>key insights</strong> from a scientific perspective on the <strong>training and functionality of our AI-driven software</strong>. This work complements analyses conducted by linguists, ensuring usability for our core audience – researchers.</p>
